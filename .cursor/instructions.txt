Build ASP.NET Core Web API + React app simulating:
1) Light ON at night (18:00–06:00) when motion random-detected, OFF after 2 simulated mins.
2) Thermostat keeps 22°C ±0.5°C, drifts to 20°C when off.
Sim time starts 17:50, +1 sim min/sec.
GET /api/state returns: sim time, light status, countdown, temp, heating, events.
React polls every second and displays data simply.
